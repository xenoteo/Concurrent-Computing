# Concurrent Computing
Tasks on concurrency made on lab classes

## Tasks
- \[[lab1](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab1)] Multi-threaded incrementing and decrementing of the same counter without data protection. Malfunctions of concurrent programs are shown.
- \[[lab2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab2/counter)] Multi-threaded incrementing and decrementing of the same counter with [semaphore](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab2/semaphores) data protection.
- \[[lab2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab2/diningPhisosophers)] Correct and incorrect implementations of the dining philosophers problem.
- \[[lab3](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab3)] Implementation of producer-consumer problem (having deadlock with some values of consumers/producers numbers).
