# Concurrent Computing
Tasks on concurrency made on lab classes

## Tasks
- Multi-threaded incrementing and decrementing of the same counter without data protection. Malfunctions of concurrent programs are shown. \[[lab1](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab1)]
- Multi-threaded incrementing and decrementing of the same counter with [binary semaphore](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/blob/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab2/Semaphore.java) data protection. \[[lab2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab2/counter)]
- Correct and incorrect implementations of the dining philosophers problem. \[[lab2](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab2/diningPhisosophers)]
